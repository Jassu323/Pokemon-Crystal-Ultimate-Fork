# Pokémon Crystal Ultimate Fork

This is a fork of [Pokémon Crystal Ultimate](https://github.com/MajorAgnostic/Pokemon-Crystal-Ultimate), which itself is based off the [Pokémon Crystal disassembly](https://pret.github.io/pokecrystal/).  I forked the PCU repo to make my own personal changes to the ROM hack.  For details about the changes between the original PCU and this one, please see the documentation below.  If you want to know how this differs from vanilla Crystal, see the documentation under the Pokémon Crystal Ultimate repository.

To set up this repository, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)  Note that this requires RGBDS **0.5.1** to build.
