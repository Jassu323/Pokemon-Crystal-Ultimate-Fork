# Explanation of Changes
## Type Matchup Changes
* Ice - The worst defensive type in the game and has been for a while.  This isn't as bad in Gen 2 because of how few Pokémon there are and Rock Slide is the hardest hitting Rock move in vanilla at 75 base power.  However, it's still a net negative to have Ice as a defensive typing, so I wanted to change that.  The most sensible change I came up with is to change Ice's wekaness to Rock into a resistance.  This enables bulky Ice types (Lapras, Dewgong, and now Corsola) to effectively switch into Rock Pokémon, which itself allows them to support teams as bulky attackers.

This doesn't turn Ice into a premier defense type like Steel or even a good one like Rock, but it does balance it out quite nicely while leaving it susceptible to powerful and prevalent attacking types in Fighting and Fire.  Likewise, dual type Water/Ice Pokémon no longer suffer the misfortune of having Ice as a typing and instead gain *some* benefit.  Depending on how this plays out, I may tweak Ice further, albeit not necessarily with more type matchup changes.

* Steel - The premier defensive type in Gen 2—so much so that the original author of PCU felt it necessary to nerf it via removing its Dark and Ghost resistances.  I agree that Steel is overbearing in its defensive capabilities, but I disagree with the choice of how to handle that.  Dark and Ghost types received several buffs to their offensive capabilities:  in base stats, in new typing changes (Meowth & Persian, Cloyster, Ninetales), and in the moves themselves.  Removing Steel's resistances to both of those types makes their offensive power overbearing in a manner reminiscent of competitive Gen 6 singles, particularly Dark given the lack of bulky Fighting types.  In order to keep Dark and Ghost in check, I've reinstated Steel's resistances to them.

However, that still leaves the original issue:  Steel being overbearing in its defensive capabilities.  It's arguable whether this is true in vanilla Crystal—I don't think it is, personally.  That said, Steel has received several buffs to its offensive capabilities, both in the Pokémon stats and especially in the moves.  This puts it into dominant territory (Scizor and Skarmory can easily carry the mid-game onward in a playthrough).  To compensate, I removed the Psychic resistance (so it now takes neutral damage from Psychic) and added an Electric weakness (so it now takes double damage from Electric).

The reasoning behind those choices is both thematic and tactical.  From a thematic standpoint, Psychic types are known for manipulating objects in the world with their mental capabilities, including incredibly heavy ones, thus it's reasonable to expect Psychic types to not be impeded by Steel (albeit not to be particularly strong against them either).  Likewise, Steel is highly conductive of electricity—not to the extent of something like silver or gold, but certainly more than water is.  As such, it makes sense thematically.  Despite these deviations from the vanilla game, I'd argue they're sensible within the logic of the Pokémon world.

From a gameplay perspective, this reduces Steel types' ability to serve as a universal wall and cements Psychic is a catchall offensive type (it only hits two types super effectively, is resisted by one, and one takes no damage from it).  I have some concerns about Psychic becoming dominant in a manner similar to Gen 1, but I have means to rectify that if so.

As for Electric, this expands its capabilities to serve as either a defensive pivot against Steel (such as with Ampharos) or an offensive check (such as with Jolteon).  I felt this small buff to Electric was worthwhile to give it some additional usability, especially with the Electric type options available in Gen 2.  Likewise, it opens up Steel to a somewhat common offensive type and requires more effective team building to cover its weaknesses.

From my view, neither of these changes seem heavy-handed, and instead seem like the optimal way to bring Steel in line with the other types.

* Water - This one's pretty simple:  I removed Water's resistance to Steel to ensure bulky Water Pokémon dual typed with Ice don't become too dominant with Ice's added resistance.  It also opens up Steel as a more useful offensive typing, providing it with an added niche for dealing with the likes of Dewgong and Lapras (somewhat similar to how Fairy is weak to Steel in Gens 6 and onward, albeit more sensible).

## Moves

1. Bug
    * Pin Missile - Made it a bit weaker but more reliable.  It felt a little overbearing early on, and this puts its average power at 45—fitting for an early-game move.

2. Dark
    * Crunch - Upped its base power because of how strong Bite is.  The difference is now a 50% increase going from Bite too Crunch instead of 33.3%, which feels more fitting.  It also gives Dark types a bit of extra offensive oomph.

3. Fighting
    * Strength - Changed it to Rock type because it overlaps too much with other Fighting moves, particularly Rock Smash.  This lowers the prevalence of Fighting type moves a bit and raises the prevalence of Rock moves in return.  Will adjust if it becomes necessary.

4. Ghost
    * Shadow Ball - Upped its base power to give Ghost more offensive output.  Existing Ghost types aren't Physical attackers, and Ghost isn't a catchall attacking type, so this shouldn't be overbearing.

5. Grass
    * Absorb, Mega Drain, and Giga Drain - I mainly wanted to up Giga Drain to 75 base power like later gens because Grass's offense felt rather weak in the later stages of the game.  Grass attacks either had 120 base power or 60 or less base power (excluding Constrict, which isn't common on Grass Pokémon).  This smoothes it out somewhat, but still leaves holes that I may revisit later.  I upped Absorb and Mega Drain to make the progression more logical (25 -> 50 -> 75 vs. 20 -> 40 -> 75).

    * Sleep Powder & Stun Store - Upped their accuracy to be more reliable.  Useful for the player, but also makes these moves more deadly against the player (and *many* Pokémon learn these moves).

    * Razor Leaf - Upped the base power so it can properly compete with Mega Drain (more damage + crit chance vs. restoring health) and Constrict.  Also improves Grass's mid-game performance a bit.

    * Solar Beam - I want 2-turn moves that are learned late (i.e. not Dig) to be properly threatening. It makes no sense for Solar Beam to hit as hard as Petal Dance despite being a 2-turn move.

6. Ground
    * Dig - Upped its base power to be more threatening early on and to give playes a better early-game Ground option that can compete with Magnitude (especially since Dig is learned via TM).  Earthquake still doubles its damage since it happens over 1 turn.

    * Mud Slap - Upped its base power to be more useful early on.  In most scenarios, it's not worth using offensively even when it's super effective.  This makes it a bit stronger.  I also upped the PP so it can be used more (especially for the accuracy drop) without having to return to the Pokémon Center.

7. Normal
    * Hyper Beam - Upped its base power since I'm making 2-turn moves 150 and I want Hyper Beam to remain as lethal as its known to be.  Only 20 less than Selfdestruct now, but Selfdestruct also halves the opponents' defense *and* Explosion still exists.

8. Poison
    * Poison Sting - I'm increasing most moves with 20 base power to 30 so they're a bit stronger in the early game.  20 feels too low unless there's something else to compensate (like Lick now having a 50% paralysis chance).

9. Psychic
    * Hypnosis - Same deal with Sleep Powder, albeit leaving Sleep Powder as the superior option (especially given its lower prevalence).  Sleeping moves (Hypnosis, Sleep Powder, and Sproe) now have a more logical accuracy progression of 70 -> 85 -> 100 instead of 60 -> 75 -> 100.

    * Psychic (move) - Upped its base power to match other moves of its kind like Surf and Flamethrower.

10. Rock
    * Rock Slide - With Strength becoming Rock type, I needed to buff Rock Slide to compensate.  I originally settled on 90, but decided 100 would be better in return for lowering its flinch chance substantially.  Sort of takes the place of Stone Edge from future generations.  Also lowered its PP to compensate.  Will keep an eye on this for now.

11. Water
    * Bubble - Same deal with Poison Sting.
